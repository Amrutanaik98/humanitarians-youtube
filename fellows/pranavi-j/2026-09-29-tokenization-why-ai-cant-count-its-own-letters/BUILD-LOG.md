# BUILD-LOG — Tokenization: Why AI Can't Count the Letters in Its Own Words

## 2026-10-02 — Full build (both aspects)

**Gate P:** Beat sheet approved 2026-10-02 (see `BEAT-SHEET.md`). **FACTCHECK:** resolved same day
— fully generic worked example, no real model/vendor named or benchmarked (see `FACTCHECK.md`).

**Audio:** Kokoro `af_bella`, all 9 beats. B00 a real silent mp3 (`ffmpeg anullsrc`, 4.056s) with
`audio_policy: "silence"` set explicitly per `build_safety.py`'s silent-required-audio gate. B01–B08
generated via `generate_audio_kokoro.py`; every duration measured via `ffprobe`, written back to
`beat_sheet.json`'s `actual_duration_s` fields. Total measured runtime: 121.04s (both aspects).

**Illustrative word:** "strawberry", counting the letter "R" — chosen because it plausibly
BPE-splits into 3 sub-word chunks, has a repeated letter worth counting (3 R's), and mirrors the
well-known "how many R's" class of example `BEAT-SHEET.md` references, without naming or
benchmarking any specific real model. The same word and same 3-chunk split (STRAW / BER / RY) are
reused across B03/B04/B05 per the Legibility Contract. B04's illustrative miscounted tally:
STRAW→1 R, BER→1 R, RY→0 R (model treats "RY" as one opaque chunk and misses the R inside it) = 2,
versus the true count of 3. B05's falsifiability case spells the same word letter-by-letter
(S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y), each letter its own token, count = 3, matching the true count — same word,
same model, only the granularity changed.

**`scenes.py` (landscape):** authored with the `T()` safe-text helper (creates `Text()` at
`font_size=48`, then scales geometrically to the intended size) used for every on-screen string —
avoids the confirmed Manim/Pango small-font-size rendering artifact (phantom gaps inside words,
e.g. "video" → "v ideo") documented in this fellow's sibling reels. Style/palette/helpers (PALETTE,
`T()`, `fit()`, `panel()`, `box_around()`, plus a new `token_chunk()` idiom for this reel's
word-splitting beats) copied from `2026-09-29-the-keyword-that-cried-wolf` and
`2026-09-22-the-all-clear-that-wasnt-all-there` for visual consistency across the series.

**Landscape final:** 3840x2160, 121.17s. GATE V (on the true final master, `--lenient`): 0 BLOCKER,
0 MAJOR. Personally re-inspected frame extractions from B05 (spelled-out fix) and B08 (brand
outro) directly from the shipped deliverable — clean text rendering, no artifacts, good composition.

**Vertical (`vertical/scenes.py`):** genuine hand-authored portrait redesign for all 9 beats
(rendered natively at 2160x3840 via the portrait `config.frame_width` patch — Manim's CLI `-r` flag
doesn't recompute `frame_width` for portrait otherwise; copied from this fellow's sibling reels'
documented fix). B02's two task cards (LEFT/RIGHT → TOP/BOTTOM stack), B04's model/true count boxes
(side-by-side → TOP/BOTTOM stack with the mismatch sign between them), and B05's 10-letter token
row (single row → two rows of 5, STRAW / BERRY split) needed real redesign, not just narrowing, to
stay legible in the narrow canvas.

**Vertical final:** 2160x3840, 121.17s — same duration as landscape, all 9 beats present, no
dropped beats, no duration cap (built via `./art vertical`, not the Shorts-style cut). GATE V (on
the true final master, `--lenient`): 0 BLOCKER, 0 MAJOR. Personally re-inspected frame extractions
from B05 and B08 directly from the shipped deliverable.

**Real bugs hit and fixed during this build:**
- **Timing arithmetic errors (landscape B02, B06):** two beats' hand-computed `self.wait()`
  remainders were wrong (a dropped addend in the "waits above" tally), causing B02's rendered clip
  to come out 1.0s longer than its measured Kokoro audio and B06's 0.5s longer. Caught by comparing
  each scene's `run_time=`/`self.wait()` sum (via a small script) against the beat's measured
  `actual_duration_s`, not by trusting the inline comments. Both fixed to match exactly.
- **GATE B layout error (landscape B05):** the "✓ MATCHES TRUE COUNT" checkmark line, placed below
  the model's-count box whenever it was too wide to fit beside it, landed with its real bottom edge
  at y=-3.6, outside the ±3.4 safe-area half-height — confirmed via `manim_layout_audit.py`'s
  real rendered-frame measurement, not a guessed margin. Fixed by raising the count box and always
  placing the checkmark below (removing the width-dependent branch).
- **GATE V canvas-fill underfill (landscape B03, B05, B06, B08):** the true final candidate (built
  without review-cut overlays, to isolate real content from the known slate-only false positive
  below) measured real underfill — B03 37%, B05 54%, B06 42%, B08 31% of the safe area (floor 55%).
  Fixed by adding a generously sized bordered frame (same idiom as B00/B01/B07) to B03/B05, enlarging
  B06's checklist card to a fixed generous size independent of its rows' own tight bounds, and
  bumping B08's font sizes/line spacing (same fix already proven on this fellow's sibling reels'
  brand-card beat). Re-verified via a direct (no-overlay) candidate build before trusting `./art final`.
- **GATE B layout errors from the B06 canvas-fill fix (2 rounds):** enlarging B06's card first
  pushed its bottom rounded corner under the closing line below, then (after raising the card)
  pushed its top corner under the title above. Fixed by trimming the card to a shorter, ORIGIN-
  centered size that clears both with real margin on the actual rendered frame.
- **GATE B off-hard-frame coordinate (vertical B05):** the first draft chained 5 `next_to()` calls
  (title → letter rows → caption → count box → checkmark), and `static_scene_check.py` caught an
  explicit resulting coordinate at y=-4.6 — off the HARD bottom edge (±4.0), not just the safe
  margin. Fixed with the proven pattern from this fellow's sibling reels: build every piece first,
  group them into one `VGroup`, arrange, cap the total height via `scale_to_fit_height`, then
  position the whole block with a single `next_to` call.
- **GATE B text-on-curve (vertical B02):** the "Wildly different reliability." zinger line landed
  directly on the bottom task card's own rounded corner — the panels' natural stacked height (5.3)
  was under the old 5.4 scale-down ceiling and so never actually got capped. Lowered the ceiling to
  4.6 so the group reliably scales down and clears the zinger with real margin.
- **Stale render cache:** `run.sh` does not detect `scenes.py` source changes and silently reuses
  old `manim/*.mp4`/`clips/*.mp4`/Manim's own `media/` cache. Deleted and re-rendered clean whenever
  a scene edit followed a prior render, and verified via `stat -f %m` that every resulting clip's
  mtime postdates `scenes.py`'s mtime before trusting any render as current.
- **GATE V false positive on the review slate cut (both aspects, confirmed non-blocking):** every
  `./art run` compiled review cut failed GATE V with 18/18 BLOCKER "edge-bleed" findings. Traced to
  `final_frame_check.py`'s `BURN_IN_EXCLUDE` region only covering the bottom-left beat-label strip,
  not the top-right review-cut timestamp overlay (`compile.py`'s `--review`-only `drawtext` burn-in)
  — confirmed by building a clean candidate (concatenated `clips/*.mp4` directly, no review overlay)
  and re-running the same check, which came back BLOCKER=0 immediately. This is a known artifact of
  the review slate, not the true final deliverable; `./art final` (which never draws review labels)
  was used for both actual masters and gated clean on its own internal (strict) GATE V check.
